## About the project

A simplified price
aggregator web-shop in groups.

The website is currently hosted [here](http://connect.learniverse.store/)

According to:
- Requirements from a customer
- Design guidelines
- Accessibility rules
- Using the best software dev practices: sprints, GIT
- Javascript for interaction and dynamic updates
- Communication with a backend API

An example of such webshop is: https://athotel.com/



## Technologies Used

This project is built using two frameworks, each representing a different side of the web application. The backend is built using Spring Boot, while the frontend is built using Vue.js. Below is a brief description of each of the:

## [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)

<div style="display: flex">

Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can "just run". It takes an opinionated view of the Spring platform and third-party libraries so you can get started with minimum fuss.

## [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/ )

<div  style="display: flex">

Vue.js is a progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. Unlike other monolithic frameworks, Vue is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable.
