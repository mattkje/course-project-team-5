# Authentication Info 

Everything "authentication" should be in the securityConfiguration package

Takes inspiration from these websites:

- https://springjavatutorial.medium.com/login-and-registration-rest-api-with-spring-security-d7ee48820bd0

- https://www.codejava.net/frameworks/spring-boot/user-registration-and-login-tutorial

Currently, using enum instead of class for role. (different from websites)
Any Custion?
